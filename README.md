# Weather Dashboard

A simple weather dashboard demonstrating a React.js orchestration layer that:
- Initiates API calls to a backend
- Validates responses using a schema validation framework (Yup)
- Dynamically updates the UI based on results

**Note:** The weather data is generated by a mock backend with hardcoded/random values for demonstration purposes. No real weather API is used, so the app is free to run and requires no API keys.

---

## Features

- Enter a city name to fetch weather info
- Response validation using Yup (React)
- Dynamic UI updates: loading, error, and success states
- Weather icons and temperature unit toggle (°C/°F) 

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Yup, Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express

## How the Weather Data Works

The backend (`weather-backend/index.js`) returns mock weather data for any city you enter. The data (temperature, condition, etc.) is randomly generated from a set of hardcoded options. This makes the app reliable for demos and interviews, with no external dependencies or API limits.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

Place all files in a directory, preserving the structure:
```
weather-backend/
  index.js
  package.json
weather-frontend/
  index.html
  package.json
  src/
    App.jsx
    index.jsx
README.md
```

### 2. Start the Backend

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
cd weather-backend
npm install
npm start
```
The backend will run at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

### 3. Start the Frontend

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
cd weather-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Vite will start the frontend, usually at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 4. Use the App

- Open the frontend URL in your browser.
- Enter a city name and submit.
- The app will fetch mock weather data from the backend, validate it, and display the results.

---

## Details

- The React frontend acts as an orchestration layer: handling user input, API calls, validation, and UI updates.
- Yup is used for schema validation of API responses.
- The backend is intentionally simple and uses mock data for reliability and ease of demonstration.
- The architecture is modular and can be extended to use a real weather API if needed.
